![template2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cf00cf3-c241-49b5-b0f3-555dad76464c)

## Introduction
This project addresses the challenges of transparency and traceability in managing donation funds in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Leveraging blockchain technology, this platform ensures secure, transparent, and real-time tracking of donations, thereby increasing donor confidence and reducing administrative costs.

## Features
- **Blockchain Technology**: Built on the Ethereum blockchain to provide an immutable and transparent record of all transactions.
- **Smart Contracts**: Developed in Solidity to automate the management and distribution of funds.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Donors can monitor the usage of their contributions in real-time.
- **Secure Transactions**: Integration with MetaMask ensures secure interactions with the blockchain.
- **Local Testing**: Utilizes Ganache for a robust local development environment.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Django Framework
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Solidity
- **Tools**: MetaMask, Ganache, Web3.js
## Pre-requisite:
- **Install NodeJS in your machine:** https://nodejs.org/en/download
- **Install VScode in your machine:** https://code.visualstudio.com/download

## Installing a cryptocurrency wallet:
To utilize the benefits of blockchain first of all we need a cryptocurrency wallet, there are many available in the market such as MetaMask, Coinbase, BitPay, etc.

For this project we will install one of the most popular among them i.e. MetaMask

The steps are as follows:

- **1. Create a new wallet**
- 
  ![met](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e176a40-b9c0-4d57-98a0-ba6c690eb1cd)

- **2.Here we have our crypto wallet**
  
  ![metamaskjpg](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e885edc0-bab5-4c4d-8f89-42bdcb1bad46)
  
But as you may notice, we have no funds here ðŸ˜”, and buying Ethereum could be quite expensive, so what can do we do ?

Let's install a local blockchain where we can test all our stuff.

## Installing Ganache:

1. Visit Truffle Suite to download Ganache

   ![ganac](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d02243dd-4fbf-4b06-a478-86c37bbf89d8)
   
2. Create a new Workspace
   
   ![ganac](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efff03e7-eb32-4766-b87a-bcc070851d42)
   
3. Here we have it, our own local blockchain
   ![ganache-3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bd28bdd-d8d8-45e3-af8b-5fa4842c4f5d)
So as of now we have our Crypto wallet set up done, and our Local Blockchain setup done; but how do we connect these two ?

## Connecting Ganache account to MetaMask Wallet:

1. Click on the MetaMask extension and click add new network
   ![metamask-g](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2530c110-a4d8-4b84-899a-1ac0bdfd3a2f)
   
2. Add the following details, like this
   ![metamask-ganache-jpg](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ac5053f-ab00-43b1-865b-50fbc8ec1aed)
   
3. And we are done with connecting our local blockchain to metamask wallet
   ![ganache-6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/486097b8-9167-40f8-a4b0-0ea86bb2f24b)
   
4. Let's add an account from our chain to the metamask, so we can have the funds available, Copy the private key from here.
   ![key](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a1b3ba7-fea3-42e4-be8d-1ba7d6c5c97f)
   
5. Click Import Account in MetaMask extension
![key2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cbc88c8-95e4-43c3-9324-902d12870d48)

6. and we have our funds in our wallet (locally only though)
