## Introduction
This project addresses the challenges of transparency and traceability in managing donation funds in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Leveraging blockchain technology, this platform ensures secure, transparent, and real-time tracking of donations, thereby increasing donor confidence and reducing administrative costs.

## Features
- **Blockchain Technology**: Built on the Ethereum blockchain to provide an immutable and transparent record of all transactions.
- **Smart Contracts**: Developed in Solidity to automate the management and distribution of funds.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Donors can monitor the usage of their contributions in real-time.
- **Secure Transactions**: Integration with MetaMask ensures secure interactions with the blockchain.
- **Local Testing**: Utilizes Ganache for a robust local development environment.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Django Framework
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Solidity
- **Tools**: MetaMask, Ganache, Web3.js
